# Realtime-Object-Detection-System
This project uses PyTorch and OpenCV to run real-time object detection with the YOLOv5s model. It captures video from your webcam, processes each frame to detect objects, and displays the results with bounding boxes and labels. Ideal for learning the basics of computer vision and deep learning with YOLO.
